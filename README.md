# Compliminder
A Discord Bot that will post a compliment at random after every message, using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).

After every message when someone says something, there will be a chance (5% by default) to compliment that person with a random compliment chosen by line from compliments.txt. After doing so, that user will be put on a cooldown for an hour before receiving any further compliments. 

Compliments can be manually given by typing "compliment" and tagging the user. 

When using this, add a file called "token.txt" with the bot token inside. Then use node compliminder to get started.
